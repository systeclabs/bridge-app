# BRIDGE "CODE NAME" APP 
Trello-like system that serves as a bridge for developers and startup founders working on tech projects. Founders can create projects and manage tasks assigned to developers on their board. 

The innovative part would be the identification system (I'm checking out Ontology) and smart contracts (Solidity).

Web Stack: Vercer/AWS (Serverless), Next.js api
Backend: Python or Go
Otonlogy --- DID - Trust-less

## BSB Tools
